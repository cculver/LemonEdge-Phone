# LemonEdge-Phone

This repository is Charles Culver's LemonEdge Development Analysis.

The project is implemented in .NET Core 6, using Blazor WASM as the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API as the backend. Yes, I was kind of bored and wanted to challenge myself. It did not take me much longer than the three hours you asked me to spend.

To run, open the solution file in Visual Studio 2022. Right click on the solution in Solution Explorer, set startup projects, and set the backend and frontend projects to start up when debugging. Start debugging from there.
